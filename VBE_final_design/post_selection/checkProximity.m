% CHECK PROXIMITY CHecks if the coordinates are too close to existing ones
%   Function made for the drawing of dots in the scrambled braille word
%   condition . The question is:
%
%                       Are the coordinates fine?
%
%   - output: boolean, the coordinates are apart-enough to allow drawing a
%             dot in that position
%   - in_coord: this coordinates x,y where to potentially draw
%   - in_array: all the other coordinates where dots are already drawn
%   - min: minimum distance, since we don't know what the font size will be

% X needs to be distant, and Y too. Distant means >= minimum
